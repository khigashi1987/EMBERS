PMC9997614: VIP signaling through VPAC1 is critical for maintaining normal gut microbiota function, with disruptions leading to significant changes in microbial diversity and metabolic pathways. 
PMC9997628: Physical activity was positively associated with the abundance of Faecalibacterium and negatively with Alistipes, Parabacteroides, and Gemmiger, as well as with concentrations of acetate, butyrate, and total SCFA. 
PMC9998685: Repeated courses and increased duration of antibiotic use in pediatric leukemia and lymphoma patients led to a decrease in Bacteroidetes and β-lactam resistance genes, and an increase in opportunistic Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and multidrug resistance genes. 
PMC9998695: The gut microbiota of plateau zokors on the Tibetan plateau is enriched in species related to energy metabolism and SCFAs production, and shows significant enrichment in carbohydrate uptake pathways and tripeptidyl-peptidase II, aiding in energy uptake and reducing inflammatory responses under extreme conditions. 
PMC9998913: The study developed a workflow named scALA to construct complete circular single-cell amplified genomes (cSAGs) from human fecal samples, revealing strain-specific structural variations and different metabolic capabilities among strains. 
PMC9998919: Significant differences in gut microbiota were observed between control individuals and heart failure patients with or without sarcopenia, with specific bacterial groups enriched in each patient category. 
PMC9998945: Supplementation with SCFP stabilized alpha diversity in horses' gut microbiomes under stress, compared to controls which showed more fluctuation. 
PMC9999011: Seasonal factors significantly affect intestinal water metabolism and the composition of intestinal flora in rats, with high temperature and humidity increasing intestinal water content and low temperature and humidity decreasing it.
